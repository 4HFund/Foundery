<h1>WHAT WE BELIEVE</h1>
<p>"What comes into our minds when we think about God is the most important thing about us." â€“ A.W. Tozer</p>
</section>
<section id="section-1">
<h2>Core Beliefs</h2>
<p>Our core beliefs are rooted in the timeless truths of the Bible. Every message, ministry, and mission at The Foundery Church flows from these foundations.</p>
</section>
<section id="section-2">
<h2>The Holy Trinity</h2>
<p>We believe in one true and living God who exists in three persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Together, they are united in love, power, and purpose.</p>
</section>
<section id="section-3">
<h2>The Son â€“ His Incarnation</h2>
<p>Jesus Christ is both fully God and fully human. Born of the Virgin Mary, He lived among us to bring reconciliation between humanity and God through His perfect life and sacrificial death.</p>
</section>
<section id="section-4">
<h2>The Son â€“ His Resurrection and Exaltation</h2>
<p>Jesus rose from the dead in victory, no longer bound by earthly limitations. He ascended to heaven, where He reigns at the right hand of the Father and intercedes for us. One day, He will return to judge the world.</p>
</section>
<section id="section-5">
<h2>The Holy Spirit â€“ His Person</h2>
<p>The Holy Spirit is the third person of the Trinityâ€”equal in power and glory. He was active in creation, present in Jesusâ€™ ministry, and continues to reveal the truth of Christ today.</p>
</section>
<section id="section-6">
<h2>The Holy Spirit â€“ His Work in Salvation</h2>
<p>The Holy Spirit helps us recognize our need for God, brings us new life, sets us apart for Godâ€™s purposes, and empowers us to grow in faith. He lives within every believer.</p>
</section>
<section id="section-7">
<h2>The Holy Spirit â€“ His Relation to the Church</h2>
<p>The Holy Spirit fuels the Churchâ€™s mission. He unites us, empowers our witness, and equips believers with gifts to build up the body of Christ and share God's love with the world.</p>
</section>
<section id="section-8">
<h2>Authority of God's Word</h2>
<p>The Bible is Godâ€™s inspired Word. It reveals who He is, how He saves, and how we should live. Guided by the Spirit, Scripture continues to speak truth across generations and cultures.</p>
</section>
<section id="section-9">
<h2>Free Moral Persons</h2>
<p>We are created in Godâ€™s image with the freedom to choose good or evil. Though sin affects us all, God gives us the grace to respond to Him through faith in Jesus, and empowers us to live with purpose.</p>
</section>
<section id="section-10">
<h2>New Life in Christ</h2>
<p>Through Jesus, weâ€™re offered a new beginning. When we repent and believe, God brings us into a right relationship with Himâ€”restoring, renewing, and adopting us into His family.</p>
</section>
<section id="section-11">
<h2>The Return of Christ</h2>
<p>Jesus is coming backâ€”and it could be any moment. His return will mark the final victory over evil. As His people, we live with hope, staying ready, joyful, and faithful.</p>
